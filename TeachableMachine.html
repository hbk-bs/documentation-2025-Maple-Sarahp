                    <p>Due to changing the topic of the project around 10 times and deleting any hint of
                        previous ideas my final idea emerged aproximately 1 day before the deadline. An AI which can
                        tell you based on a uploaded photo or live image
                        wich genre of music your surroundings would be. I was inspired from an old Snapchatfilter that
                        would just put a frame around your picture.
                        Totally useless but your could kind of romantisize your life.</p>
                    <p>The training of the AI was simple and I sped through the album covers and genres quick.
                        Building the page worked just as well and I really liked the colors. I also experimented with
                        gifs in this project and could learn more about linking and referencing different formats.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately one of the few things that didn't work was that the AI only recognized and decided
                        based on colors. They could identify the real album cover but if your were to show them
                        a face or a bottle of water for example it would always state POP-music. Another problem I had
                        was the fact that the output window was still a default one.
                        Furthermore did I subconciously switch from english to german in the website texts and did not
                        create an image upload button.</p>
                    <p>But all in all it was a really fun experience. Taking insights and experience in AI training with
                        me as well as learning to implement them in a website.</p>
