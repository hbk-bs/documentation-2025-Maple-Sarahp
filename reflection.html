                <h1>Reflecting On The Semester</h1>

                <p>The overall topic of this semester was artificial intelligence, something I did not expect much from.
                    And even though I wasn't really fond of the topic I still learned a lot in these past months.
                    With that not only more about coding but also AI itself and its uses and misuses.
                </p>
                <p>The projects under the main topic really intrigued me. Learning to notice small movements in nature
                    and translating them
                    into code. To make something technical look natural was really </p>
                <p>Tools that stuck with me were</p>
                <p>What really suprised me was that I changed my mind about AIs. Not much. But a bit. Learning how
                    versatile and extensive the topic of AI was. Working a whole semester
                    with different types of AIs showed me many ways to use it. Adding the debate on it really expanded
                    my knowledge wich I'm really greatful for. </p>
                <p>In total was the semester really fun. Not only having the chance for the Amrum excursion but learning
                    more about coding and how to use, cooperate and teach AIs actually was more interesting than I
                    thought. So thank you. I may not be that expirienced in coding yet but taking the digital course in
                    my next semester does not seems out of the question anymore. </p>
