                <h1>Reflecting On The Semester</h1>

                <p>The overall topic of this semester was artificial intelligence, something I did not expect much from.
                    And even though I wasn't really fond of the topic I still learned a lot in these past months.
                    With that not only more about coding but also AI itself and its uses and misuses. In a debate I
                    digga ich kack ab ich weiß garnix mehr.
                </p>
                <p>The projects really intrigued me. </p>
                <p>What tools, techniques, and concepts stuck with you?</p>
                <p></p>
                <p>What really suprised me was how versatile and extensive the topic of AI was. Working a whole semester
                    with different types of AIs showed me many ways to use it. </p>
                <p>In total was the semester really fun. Not only having the chance for the Amrum excursion but learning
                    more about coding and how to use, cooperate and teach AIs actually was more interesting than I thought. So thank you.</p>
