                <h1>Reflecting On The Semester</h1>

                <p>The overall topic of this semester was artificial intelligence, something I did not expect much from.
                    And even though I wasn't really fond of the topic I still learned a lot in these past months.
                    With that not only more about coding but also AI itself and its uses and misuses, chances and
                    challenges.
                </p>
                <p>The projects under the main topic really intrigued me. Learning to notice small movements in nature
                    and translating them into code. To make something technical look natural was really fun to
                    experiment with. Also working with the LLM and teaching it to do what I wanted was a fun challenge.
                    I learned a lot about prompts how to compile and apply them in the most efficient way. If I had to
                    choose which project was my favourite I'd say the Code of Nature. It was really fun having this
                    whole journey of observing, finding interesting movements and then trying to break them down and
                    experimenting. But the other projects were interesting as well.
                </p>
                <p>What really suprised me this semester was that I actually changed my mind about AIs. Not much. But a
                    bit. Learning
                    how versatile and extensive the topic of AI was. Learning about areas of use I did not think about
                    like AI helping
                    in medical fields for early detection or scientific research. But until now the problems with
                    environmental damage and misuse outweigh that.
                    Working a whole semester
                    with different types of AIs let me get an overview and a lot of expirience in
                    teaching AI, prompting AI, and working in cooperation with AI. Also adding the debate on it really
                    expanded my knowledge which I'm really greatful for.
                </p>
                <p>In total the semester was really fun. Not only having the chance for the Amrum excursion but learning
                    even more about coding and how to use, cooperate and teach AIs actually was more interesting than I
                    thought. Some frustrating moments yes but you learn from mistakes right? So thank you. I may not be
                    that expirienced in coding yet but taking the digital course in
                    my next semester does not seems out of the question anymore.
