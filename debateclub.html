                    <p>
                        To learn more about AI, its possibilities and limitations, the whole class held a debate.
                        Divided into two groups, pros and cons, we first presented basic facts and then discussed the
                        topic whether AI should be used as designers or not.
                    </p>
                    <p>As I was on team pro-AI I took away that AI can be used in scientific fields for evaluation and
                        analysis as well as in the medical field for early detection of difficult to detect diseases
                        like some forms of cancer. </p>
                    <p>The question though was whether AI was useful for designers and should be utilized. AI learns
                        from existing art. Copyright maybe a gray zone right now but some artist dont even know if their
                        art was used to teach an AI. Depending too much on AI let's people get lazy. Right now its still
                        a bit difficult to get constant results but in the future that will for shure change. Using it
                        just isn't the same as commissioning an artist or designer who can work not only based on your
                        prompt but also your character and people skills.
                    </p>
                    <p>In the end of the debate my opinion did in fact change a bit. I think AI can be really helpful in
                        the medical field and working in cooperation with humans. Saving lifes and early detection of
                        diseases is crucial for me. But in the art field it remains a no-go for me. Right now it only
                        seems lazy. Like giant companies using bad AI ads only to save money. But thats only my
                        opinion for now, maybe in the future we will depend on it. Who knows for ssure.</p>
