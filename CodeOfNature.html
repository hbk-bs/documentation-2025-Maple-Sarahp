                    <p>Searching through Amrum on an excursion to find an interesting movement in untouched nature a few
                        things came to mind. The sea waves and their remains in the sand, the flocks of nesting birds.
                        But what caught my eye in the end was a
                        little bush that
                        grew all over the island. The way it split up into new branches kind of interested me and gave
                        me ideas how I could translate into code.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="media">
                    <img src="./img/welle2.jpg" alt="Wave movement">

                <div class="text-content">
                    <p>I achieved progress through experimenting with Fabians coded shrub wich was kinda already how
                        I imagined the bush to look like. So from there on out I was only playing around. But
                        decided to
                        convert another bush i found into code. This one didn't grew upwards but rather up and
                        falling
                        down again. </p>
                    <p>Sadly because of the fact that I couldn't code that well that the branching and falling
                        looked
                        lifelike and I was too scared to ask anyone I also let that idea go. I then started to zoom
                        into
                        the shrub and chose to randomize a stick. Every click shows a new twig.
