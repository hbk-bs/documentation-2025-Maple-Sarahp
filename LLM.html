                    <p>Pen and Paper is too oldschool and you don't want to stand up? Let's do that online! You have no
                        friends to play with? No Problem! You play against AI.
                        I wanted create a quick bossfight against a beast of any kind. In it the Player has to choose
                        between fighting, defending or magic wich can only be used once per game. </p>
                    <p>The basic trainig of the AI went really well. Likewise was the building of a theme fitting
                        website. </p>
                    <p>The problems started with cosmetic changes of the LLM Json Output.
                        No matter what I wrote, how often I asked another AI and Fabian or threatend to harm small
                        kitties,
                        the output always looked the same. Frustrating.</p>
