                    <p>Pen and Paper is too oldschool and you don't want to stand up? Let's do that online! You have no
                        friends to play with? No Problem! You play against AI.
                        I wanted create a quick bossfight against a beast of any kind. In it the Player has to choose
                        between fighting, defending or magic wich can only be used once per game. </p>
                    <p>The basic trainig of the ValTown LLM and outlining the rules for the game went really well.
                        Likewise was the building of a theme fitting
                        website where I experimented with backgrounds and button images.</p>
                    <p>But the problems started early with cosmetic changes of the LLMs Json Output.
                        No matter what I wrote, how often I asked another AI and Fabian or threatend to harm small
                        kitties, the output always looked the same. Frustrating. It was definetly not my topic as I was
                        loosing myself in prompting the outlines of the game when the tast was to be creative and not
                        build a chatbot. In spite of all I still learned a lot from the tast. How clear you have to
                        state promts to the LLM or to mind the fact that too much text can 'confuse' the LLM. </p>
